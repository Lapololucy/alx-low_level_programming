The make utility is a software tool for managing and maintaining
computer programs consisting many component files. The make utility
automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be
recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
• Make reads its instruction from Makefile (called the descriptor file) by
default.
• Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program
need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them.
• Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other
complex tasks with dependencies.
• Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix(or implicit)
rules.
